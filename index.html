      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="lead">Effective date: <strong>October 6, 2025</strong></p>

      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Double M Mobile App</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, discloses, and protects information from users ("you") of our mobile application or website. By using MyApp, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

        <li><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> For web usage, we use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies to operate and improve our services.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <li>To detect, prevent, and address technical issues, fraud, and security incidents.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>

        <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> Third-party vendors who perform services on our behalf (payment processors, analytics providers, hosting providers).</li>
        <li><strong>Legal reasons:</strong> When required by law, to respond to legal process, or to protect rights, safety, or property.</li>

      <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>We may use third-party services (e.g., analytics, crash reporting, advertising partners). These services have their own privacy policies and may collect information independently. Examples include Google Analytics, Firebase, Stripe, and social login providers. Please consult those providers' policies for more information.</p>

      <h2>5. Cookies & Tracking</h2>
      <p>We use cookies and similar technologies to improve functionality, analyze usage, and support advertising where applicable. You can control cookie preferences through your browser or device settings; however disabling certain cookies may affect app functionality.</p>
